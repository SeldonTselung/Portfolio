# Portfolio

I learned a lot of HTML, CSS and meta-tagging through building a personal portfolio site. 
This way the site remains static while being responsive and we get to host the site for free through Github Pages.
Feel free to fork this project if you're feeling the simplicity. This design was inspired by Brittany Chiang's website, which is amazing and dynamic. You can fork her work here https://github.com/bchiang7/v4


Cheers!
