# Portfolio
https://seldontselung.com
Here's a responsive personal portfolio site built from scratch using HTML and CSS. It's static so it can be hosted for free through github pages. Feel free to fork this project if you're feeling the simplicity. 

Note: This design layout was inspired by Brittany Chiang's website. You can fork her work here https://github.com/bchiang7/v4


Cheers!
