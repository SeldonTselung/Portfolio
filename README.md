# Portfolio
https://seldontselung.com
Here's a mobile and web responsive personal portfolio site built from scratch using only HTML, CSS and vanilla JS. It showcases all the projects I have worked on so far. It's static so it can be hosted for free through github pages. Feel free to fork this project if you're feeling the simplicity. 

Note: This design layout was inspired by Brittany Chiang's website. You can fork her work here https://github.com/bchiang7/v4


Cheers!
